This is a rewrite of the Chaos webapp.
Chaos is a variant of play for Magic: the Gathering.
It adds random effects at the start of each turn. You'll "roll" on the Chaos List and do what it says before each turn.
The original game rules and list are here:

This is a slightly altered version. This app will take care of the rolling and looking up of the effect on the list for you.
When you're instructed to roll on a different list just hit that list button for a roll.

If an effect references a die role, for example 1d6, it'll generate a roll for you and include it in italics. Feel free to use this or roll yourself. We've included some extra die roll options toward the bottom of the page.

If an effect instructs you to look through a list you can find the full list behind the options button.
