    "1 - Josh - Roll a D6. For each opponent, lose that much life. Each opponent gains that much life. Until you have taken that many turns: you and permanents you control have hexproof, and cannot be attacked, and creatures you control are unblockable.",
    "2 - Jake - Put a 5/5 blue Squid token into play under your control. Until your next turn, whenever a roll is made on Personaland, put an additional 5/5 blue Squid token into play under your control.",

    "5- Lee - You and target opponent exchange life totals.",
    "6 - Mark Rosewater - Roll three times on without resolving any of those rolls. Instead, get a proxy of each roll and put these proxies into your hand.

    "7 - Brian - Get a Brian counter. Sacrifice Brian to add or subtract ten from the value of X in any casting cost that includes an X.",
    "8 - Dylan - Choose one: gain two life for each green creature in play or play two spells from your hand without paying their casting cost.",

    "12 - Ian - Use the force to move any card in play to any other player's control. Treat that card as though that card's new controller just cast it. Destroy all EnchantWorldLands. Roll in EnchantWorldLand .",
    "13 - Grahame - Get a Grahame counter. When you die, you may sacrifice Grahame. If you do, shuffle your deck back into your library and rejoin the game at half of your previous starting life total, rounded up.",
    "14 - Mike - Look at all players' hands. As many times as you wish, you may pay one life to force a player to discard a card of your choice.",
    "15- Trevin - Put a Trevin counter on each of your creatures. While a creature has a Trevin counter on it, it gains +1/+1. Remove a Trevin counter from a creature to have it deal one damage to any target.",
    "16 - Sharon - Target creature you control becomes a Sharon Sniper and may not attack. Roll a D6. You may tap Sharon Sniper to do an amount of damage equal to that roll to any attacking creature.",
    "17 - Weissman Blast! - Ban any card that isn't a basic land. Search all libraries, hands, graveyards, and cards in play and remove any now-illegal copies of chosen card from the game.",
    "18 - Manhito - Choose one - Roll in Wackyland , PersonaLand , or EnchantWordLand . If later in the game you are told to roll in the chosen list, re-roll that roll.",
    "19 - Shroomie - Create a proxy of any card in Magic of your choice and place it out of play. At end of each turn, each player rolls a D6. If a 6 is rolled, place the proxy in that players hand.",
